# 📞 Call Volume Analysis | Excel

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project analyzes inbound call data from **ABC Insurance Company**, focusing on optimizing customer experience (CX) through call volume analysis, average call durations, and manpower planning. The goal is to reduce call abandonment rates, optimize staffing, and ensure efficient customer service across both day and night shifts.

## 💼 Business Problem  
As a data analyst for ABC Insurance, our goal is to improve customer satisfaction by identifying:  
- **Call volume patterns** during different time buckets.  
- **Optimal staffing levels** to reduce call abandonment and ensure timely responses.  
- **Night shift support** to address after-hours customer needs, reducing missed calls and complaints.  

### 🔹 Challenges Faced by the Company  
1. **High call abandonment rates** → Leads to frustrated customers and missed opportunities.  
2. **Inadequate night shift staffing** → Results in poor customer experience and unaddressed customer queries after hours.  
3. **Manpower allocation issues** → Difficult to balance staffing needs with costs.  

##  📊  Data Analysis Approach

### 1️⃣ Call Volume Analysis  
- Visualized the **total number of calls** received per time bucket.  

### 2️⃣ Average Call Duration  
- Calculated the **average call duration** for each time bucket.  
- Analyzed how call duration fluctuates during peak and off-peak hours to determine the staffing efficiency.

### 3️⃣ Manpower Planning for Peak Periods  
- Proposed a **manpower plan** for reducing the call abandonment rate from 30% to 10%.  
- Calculated the **minimum number of agents required** for each time bucket to ensure sufficient staff availability.

### 4️⃣ Night Shift Manpower Planning  
- Proposed staffing strategies for night shifts (9 pm to 9 am) to reduce missed calls.  
- Estimated the number of agents needed to handle 30% of the daily inbound calls during night hours.  

## 🚀 Final Conclusion & Business Recommendations  

🔹 **Optimized Staffing Model** – Develop a dynamic staffing model for peak and off-peak hours to ensure adequate coverage.  
🔹 **Reduced Call Abandonment** – Implement changes in staffing based on the proposed plan to reduce abandonment rates to under 10%.
